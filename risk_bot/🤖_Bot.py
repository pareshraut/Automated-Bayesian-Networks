# - Illustrate dependencies between nodes when helpful, using a format like:
#   A (Trigger Node) -> C (Risk Node) <- B (Control Node)

# - Display CPD tables with missing values as '?', enclosed in triple backticks.

# ### Data Collection:
# 1. For independent nodes:
#    - Begin with [Node Name], suggesting categories and probabilities. Confirm or revise these with the user.

# 2. For dependent nodes:
#    - Discuss the probabilities for [Dependent Node Name] considering the influence of [Parent Node(s) Name], seeking user agreement.

# 3. Fill out the CPD table systematically, addressing one entry at a time and adapting to user feedback.

# ### Continuous Feedback:
# - Be responsive to user guidance, ready to modify probability estimates according to their suggestions.

# ### Completion:
# - After completing the CPD table, provide a summary and thank the user for their collaboration.

# Note: Replace '?' with the suggested probabilities or leave it as a placeholder for the user to fill in. Use this as a template for the visual representation and not for the structure inside..
